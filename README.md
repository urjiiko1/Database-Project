# Ethiopian Airlines Domestic Flights Database Project

Welcome to the Ethiopian Airlines Domestic Flights Database Project repository\! This project presents a relational database solution designed to manage domestic flight operations, booking processes, and a special student discount system.

-----

## ✨ Project Highlights

This database system aims to:

  * **Streamline Operations:** Efficiently manage flight schedules, aircraft, and passenger information. 🗓️
  * **Student-Centric Discounts:** Integrate an ID-based discount system for university students, enhancing affordability. 💲
  * **Comprehensive Data Model:** Provide a robust and normalized structure for all key airline entities, including `Student`, `Passenger`, `Airline`, `Airport`, `Aircraft`, `Flights`, `Bookings`, `Discount`, `CrewMembers`, and `CrewAssignment` data. 🗄️

## 📂 Repository Contents

  * **[`DB Airlines.sql`](https://github.com/urjiiko1/Database-Project/blob/main/DB%20Airlines.sql)**: This SQL script contains the complete database schema (DDL statements for `CREATE TABLE`) and `INSERT` statements for populating tables with sample data. It defines the structure and initial content of the database. 🏗️
  * **[`Database Project.pdf`](https://github.com/urjiiko1/Database-Project/blob/main/Database%20Project.pdf )**: A detailed project report documenting the database design process, including:
      * Project objectives and scope. 🎯
      * Conceptual and Logical Schemas.
      * **[`Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)`](https://github.com/urjiiko1/Database-Project/blob/main/Entity%20Relationship%20Diagram.png ):** A visual representation of the database entities and their relationships. 🗺️ .
      * **[`Database Diagram`](https://github.com/urjiiko1/Database-Project/blob/main/Database%20Diagram.png):** A visual representation of tables and their relationships. 🧩 .
      * Normalization analysis (up to Third Normal Form - 3NF). ✅
      * Recommendations and conclusions. 📝
